The test, train and val data was shared with my co-author Stefano. From now, on these files that had previously been located in 
R:\Data\VaalerIIII\2023\MLS\test_train_segmented in the folders test_segmentation, train_segmentation, and val were copied to a 
new folder that it would be possible to share with Stefano. The location of this folder was C:\Users\mamoan\OneDrive - Norwegian University of Life Sciences\PHD\Paper_3_young_stands\data
and the folder names were test, train, and val.
