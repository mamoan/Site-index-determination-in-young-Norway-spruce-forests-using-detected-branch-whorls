Stefano projected the point clouds in the folder train located in the C:\Users\mamoan\OneDrive - Norwegian University of Life Sciences\PHD\Paper_3_young_stands\data folder
to the 2D plane using a code that he has. He made images of the sliced point cloud viewed from different angles. These images were uploaded to the website
trainYOLO.com where I annotated bounding boxes and keypoints for these images. These annotations were used to further train the detector.
