RUN_ONLY_ONCE_export_LAS_files created point clouds of segmented trees in the folders 
R:\\Data\\VaalerIIII\\2023\\MLS\\test_train_segmented\\test_segmentation\\ and 
files in R:\\Data\\VaalerIIII\\2023\\MLS\\test_train_segmented\\train_segmentation\\

I went through all files in this folder to see if any of the segmented point clouds needed to be manually segmented. Point clouds were
manually segmented from scratch if the point clouds revealed that the segmentation had been unsucessful. Sometimes the automatic segmentation was poor and the point clouds were adjusted. 

Results were saved in a new folder structure. Folders test_segmentation and train_segmentation contained the files to be used further.The folders test_automatic_that_had_to_be_edited and train_automatic_that_had_to_be_edited contained copies of the files that were edited in their original version, i.e., before they were edited.
